I have a Bachelors in Mathematics from Cambridge, focusing on pure and applicable maths. I am currently studying on an AI Core Data Science track, while running a custom vintage clothing store as a hobby. I am interested in excelling my skills in Data Analytics and Data Science and working on various projects, so I am open to collaboration. I am also involved in some maths Olympiads, such as Ukrainian National Olympiad and coordination at EGMO.
